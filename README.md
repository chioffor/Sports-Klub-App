# Sports-Club-App
Python, Tkinter, MySQL

A Sports Club app using Tkinter and MySQL.

# Sports_klub.py
The App enables us:
- Add a club
- Add a player, taking into account the club the player belongs to
- Show info about a club as well assigning a player to the club
- Deleting a club
- Deleting a player
- Changing a player's club

(Unfortunately the code is in Polish language because my course was in polish language)

# Sports_klub.txt
This file includes details about the 2 tables created for the app. Table "klub" and "zawodnik".
